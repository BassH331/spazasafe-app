## 🚨 The Problem

In 2024, South Africa experienced a devastating food poisoning crisis. **22+ children lost their lives** and **890+ were hospitalized** due to counterfeit food products sold through informal retail channels.

Over **100,000 spaza shops** serve millions of South Africans daily, but until now, there was no way to verify product authenticity at the point of purchase.

**SpazaSafe changes that.**

---

## 💡 What is SpazaSafe?

SpazaSafe is a **free mobile application** that uses artificial intelligence to detect counterfeit food products instantly. Using just your smartphone camera, you can verify if a product is authentic before you buy it.

```
📱 Scan Barcode  →  📸 Capture Product  →  🧠 AI Analysis  →  ✅ Verdict
```

### How It Works

| Step | Action | What Happens |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **1** | Scan the barcode | Identifies the product in our database |
| **2** | Take a photo | Captures the product packaging |
| **3** | AI analyzes | Compares against verified reference images |
| **4** | Get verdict | SAFE ✅ / CAUTION ⚠️ / DANGER ❌ |

---

## 🧠 The Technology

SpazaSafe uses **three layers of forensic analysis**:

| Analysis | Technology | What It Detects |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Structure** | ResNet18 Deep Learning | Packaging design differences invisible to the human eye |
| **Geometry** | ORB Keypoint Detection | Logo placement errors, spatial distortions |
| **Color/Ink** | HSV Histogram Analysis | Printing quality deviations, ink differences |

**Database:** 5,840+ verified South African products and growing.
